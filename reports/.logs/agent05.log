I've completed the ADHD-Specific UX Audit. Here's a summary:

## ADHD UX Audit Complete

**Overall Verdict: A- (Genuinely designed for ADHD)**

### Key Findings:

**What's Excellent:**
- **Stack View** - Shows ONE task at a time, eliminating choice paralysis
- **AI Task Breakdown** - Does the planning work that ADHD brains struggle with
- **Focus Mode** - Minimal UI with timer for time awareness
- **"I'm Stuck" Button** - Normalizes getting stuck without judgment
- **Time Estimates** - Steps show "Est. 5 min" which combats time blindness
- **Zero Shame Patterns** - No guilt-inducing "overdue" warnings or productivity shaming

**Decision Count Analysis:**
| Flow | Decisions | Verdict |
|------|-----------|---------|
| First open → action | 0 | Frictionless |
| Add simple task | 1 | Frictionless |
| Add complex task | 2 | Acceptable |

**What's Missing:**
1. Surface the gamification (XP/streaks exist in code but aren't visible)
2. "Quick wins" filter (show tasks under 5 min)
3. Deadline/due date support
4. "Pick for me" random task button
5. Body doubling mode

### Brutal Assessment Quote:
> "This is the real deal. Gather shows deep understanding of executive dysfunction. The Stack view isn't a gimmick - it's a philosophical commitment to 'one thing at a time.' The absence of shame is perhaps the most telling sign. This app gets it."
