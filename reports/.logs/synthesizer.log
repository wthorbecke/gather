I've created the master synthesis report. Here's the summary:

## Master Synthesis Complete

The report is saved at `/reports/MASTER_SYNTHESIS.md`. Here are the key findings:

### The Brutal Truth
Gather is a **genuinely good product trapped in an almost-finished state**. The ADHD-specific philosophy is real and thoughtful. But the app commits a cardinal sin: **the Done button in Stack View doesn't respond to clicks** (requires a hidden 500ms hold). This breaks the core loop right when users need their first dopamine hit.

### The Core Problem
The app delivers value but fails to deliver satisfaction at completion. The confetti component exists but doesn't fire. The checkbox has no animation. The micro-celebrations that ADHD users need simply don't happen.

### Critical Issues (Fix Before Anyone Sees It)
1. **Done button broken** - Add onClick handler, not just hold-to-complete
2. **Confetti never triggers** - Wire up the existing component
3. **Checkbox has no animation** - Add spring bounce
4. **Input click blocked** - Fix pointer-events on overlay

### What's Actually Good (Don't Change)
- AI task breakdown with real URLs/phone numbers (unique differentiator)
- "No onboarding, just start" philosophy
- Warm coral + sage green palette
- Zero shame/guilt patterns
- Step-level time estimates

### The Unlock
Stream the first step immediately while continuing to research subsequent steps. Cuts perceived latency from 4-5 seconds to under 1 second.

### Final Verdict
**Alpha/Beta boundary** - One critical bug (Done button) from being beta-ready. The product understanding is exceptional. Fix that single interaction and this is ready for early adopters.
