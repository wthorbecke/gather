Code quality audit complete. Report saved to `reports/07_code_quality.md`.

**Summary of findings:**

**Critical Issues:**
- `GatherApp.tsx` at 1541 lines with 155 functions is a god component
- `StackView.tsx` (931 lines) and `useUserData.ts` (756 lines) are similarly bloated
- 48-50 hooks in single components

**Type Safety: C+**
- 7 explicit `any` uses (all in AI response parsing)
- No `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, or eslint disables

**Code Smells Found:**
- 167 console.log statements that shouldn't ship
- 1 TODO comment
- Prop drilling 3+ levels deep
- Magic timeout numbers scattered throughout
- Duplicate fetch patterns

**Dead Code:**
- 4 components with 0 imports (EmailModal, GameUI, ReflectionCard, StatsCard)
- 3 empty API directories

**Error Handling Gaps:**
- No error boundaries
- localStorage access without try-catch (8+ locations)
- Inconsistent fetch error handling

**If you have 4 hours:** Add error boundaries, wrap localStorage, remove console.logs, extract task creation logic.

**If you have 4 days:** Split the god component, restructure data hooks, add proper typing, implement error handling throughout.
