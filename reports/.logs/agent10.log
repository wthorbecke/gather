I've completed the Delight & Emotion Audit. Here's the summary:

## Key Findings

**What's Delightful:**
- Empty state "clear / nothing waiting" is calming, not guilt-tripping
- AI loading states feel conversational and human
- Step subtitles show real personality ("Tackle the grossest room first")
- The "All done / Nothing left. Enjoy it." completion message is perfectly toned
- Sage green success color and coral accent are distinctive
- Dark mode is well-executed

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Task completion confetti doesn't fire** - The code exists in `Confetti.tsx` and is imported in `GatherApp.tsx`, but it didn't trigger when I completed all 6 steps. This is THE dopamine moment for ADHD users.

2. **Done button in stack view appears non-functional** - Multiple clicks didn't complete the step. Had to switch to list view to use checkboxes.

3. **Missing micro-animations** - Checkbox completion is instant with no bounce/spring. Cards have no transition animations.

**Dopamine Report Card: D+**
- The reward loop is *designed* correctly but *broken* in execution
- Fix the confetti trigger and this becomes a B+

**Overall Delight Score: 6/10**
The soul and craft are clearly present. The voice is warm and human. But the celebration moments - the critical dopamine triggers for the target ADHD audience - are disconnected. One debugging session would dramatically improve the emotional experience.
