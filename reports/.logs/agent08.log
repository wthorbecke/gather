I've completed the competitive analysis report. Here's the summary:

## Key Findings

**True Differentiators Gather Has:**
1. **AI Research + Task Breakdown** - Gather actually researches your specific situation (Googles state-specific forms, finds real phone numbers, deadlines)
2. **Pre-filled Action URLs** - Steps include `tel:` links, payment URLs, case numbers - everything needed to execute
3. **AI Clarifying Questions** - Asks context before generating steps, making output actually useful
4. **"I'm Stuck" Chat** - Context-aware help when users hit walls mid-task
5. **Rich Step Metadata** - Alternatives, examples, checklists, sources, time estimates in every step

**Critical Gaps:**
- No mobile native app (web-only is a dealbreaker for consumer apps)
- No visual timeline/time blocking (Tiimo's core strength)
- No Android support (40%+ of market)
- Tiimo won App Store App of the Year 2025 - massive brand advantage

**Competitive Position:**
- Gather has *better* AI task breakdown than Tiimo/Llama Life (depth, research, action URLs)
- But Tiimo has *better* distribution (App Store presence, brand, visual polish)
- Motion/Reclaim are not real competitors - different use case (auto-scheduling vs. task help)

**The Honest Answer:**
Gather fills a real gap - the space between "I know what I should do" and "I'm actually doing it." The AI research + pre-filled actions is genuinely differentiated. But the moat is weak (Tiimo could copy these features), and distribution (web-only, no brand) is the critical weakness.

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Get on the App Store immediately
2. Own "AI does the research" messaging
3. Target the "ADHD tax" pain point (late fees, missed refunds)
4. Create a free tier with viral potential
5. Don't chase visual timelines - deepen the AI research advantage
