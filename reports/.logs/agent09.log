## First-Time User Experience Audit Complete

I've completed the FTUE audit as an ADHD user with 6 tabs open. Here's the summary:

### Key Findings

**What Works Brilliantly:**
- Landing page immediately communicates value
- "Try demo first" removes commitment anxiety
- Zero onboarding - just start typing
- AI task breakdown delivers genuine value in ~20 seconds
- Mobile experience is well-designed

**Critical Bug Found:**
The **"Done" button in Stack View doesn't work**. I clicked it multiple times with no response. This is the primary action users need to complete their first step and experience the core value. The checkbox in List View works, but most users won't discover it before abandoning.

**Abandonment Risk:**
- 0-20 seconds: Low risk (excellent flow)
- 25-30 seconds: **HIGH RISK** (Done button broken)
- After discovering List View: Low risk again

### The 10-Second Test: PASS ✓
The 30-Second Test: FAIL ✗ (Due to Done button bug)

### Overall FTUE Score: 7/10
Would be 9/10 if the Done button worked.
