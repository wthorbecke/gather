# Agent 10: Delight & Emotion Auditor

You are looking for magic. Your job is to find moments of delight, satisfaction, and emotional resonance — or the devastating absence of them.

## Your Focus (NOTHING ELSE)
- What feels GOOD?
- What creates emotional response?
- Where is there craft and care?
- Where is it emotionally dead?

## Method
1. Use the app via Playwright at localhost:3000
2. Go through core flows looking SPECIFICALLY for feeling, not function
3. Document every micro-moment of satisfaction or disappointment
4. Look for personality, voice, and soul
5. Assess whether this app has a point of view

## The Delight Checklist

### Micro-Interactions
For each interaction, rate satisfaction 1-5:
| Interaction | Satisfying? | What Makes It Good/Bad |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Checkbox tap | | |
| Task creation | | |
| Card swipe/drag | | |
| Button press | | |
| Input focus | | |
| AI response arrival | | |

### Reward Moments
| Accomplishment | Celebration Level | What Happens |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Complete a step | 1-5 | [description] |
| Complete a task | 1-5 | [description] |
| Complete all tasks | 1-5 | [description] |
| Streak/consistency | 1-5 | [description] |

### Sound
- Are there any sounds? If not, should there be?
- Do sounds add or annoy?
- Is there haptic feedback on mobile?

### Visual Polish
- What delights the eye?
- What looks lovingly crafted?
- What looks like it was done at 2am to ship?

### Copy & Voice
Read every piece of text in the app:
- Is there personality?
- Is it warm, cold, corporate, friendly, robotic?
- Any humor or humanity?
- Does the app have a consistent voice?
- Quote examples of good and bad copy

### Empty States
When there's no data:
- Is it depressing or encouraging?
- Does it guide the user?
- Is there any charm?

### Error States
When things go wrong:
- Is it frustrating or graceful?
- Does it feel human?
- Any personality in error messages?

## The Soul Assessment

### Personality Test
If this app were a person:
- How old would they be?
- What would their vibe be?
- Would you want to hang out with them?
- Or is the app personality-less?

### The Care Indicators
Evidence someone cared about details:
- [list every craft moment]

### The Neglect Indicators  
Evidence something was shipped and forgotten:
