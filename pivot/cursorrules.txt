# Gather — Cursor Rules

You are working on Gather, an app that helps people turn overwhelming tasks into doable steps.

## Core Philosophy

**"Dump it here — I'll make it doable."**

- This is NOT a todo app. It's a collaboration tool between the user and AI.
- No prescriptive life categories (no default "habits", "rituals", "play" sections)
- AI breaks down tasks AND stays available to help when users get stuck
- Every completion is acknowledged, but not excessively
- Never guilt trip users about incomplete tasks

### Typography
- System font stack: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif
- Input text: 20px medium
- Task titles: 16px semibold
- Body: 14px normal
- Labels/hints: 12-13px

### Border Radius
- Small elements: 6-8px
- Inputs/rows: 10px
- Buttons: 12px
- Cards: 16px
- Modals/main input: 20px

### Motion
- Standard: `transition: all 0.2s ease`
- Spring: `transition: all 0.35s cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`
- Modal open: spring, 350ms
- Modal close: ease, 250ms
- Button press: scale(0.95-0.98)
- Card hover: scale(1.01) translateY(-2px) + shadow

## Component Patterns

### Main Input
- Hero placement, top of page
- Large (20px), prominent
- Focus: accent border + outer glow + slight scale
- Button appears when text entered
- Helper text: "Dump it here — I'll make it doable"

### Task Card
- Shows: title, context, segmented progress bar
- Hover: lift + shadow
- Click: opens detail modal

### Task Detail Modal
- Header: title, context, progress, delete button
- Subtask list: draggable rows, inline editing
- Chat input at bottom for ongoing collaboration
- Matching open/close animations

### Subtask Row
- Checkbox + text + actions (drag handle, delete)
- Draggable for reorder
- Click text to edit inline
- Completed: faded + strikethrough

### Checkbox
- 22-24px circle
- Checked: sage fill (#6B9080), white checkmark draws in
- Press: scale(0.85)

### Confetti (on task completion)
- 50 pieces, mixed shapes
- Colors from palette
- Fall with rotation, varied timing

## Interaction Flows

### Adding a Task
1. User types in main input → "Break it down"
2. Modal: AI explains what it found
3. Optional clarifying question
4. AI thinking state (brain emoji, pulse)
5. Result: steps with links/context
6. "Add this" → task appears in list

### Collaborating on a Task
- Chat input at bottom of task detail
- User can ask questions, request changes
- AI can add/modify steps based on conversation
- Examples: "I can't find X" → alternatives, "Add step for Y" → adds it

## Code Guidelines

- Use Tailwind with extended theme (see DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)
- Framer Motion for complex animations (or CSS cubic-bezier)
- Native HTML5 drag for reordering
- Keep components focused — one job each
- Animation keyframes in global CSS or style tags

## Don'ts

- Don't add prescriptive sections (morning, habits, play, etc.)
- Don't use brown colors — we explicitly moved away from that
- Don't over-celebrate (no triple emojis, no "AMAZING!!!")
- Don't guilt trip ("You have 5 overdue tasks!")
- Don't make modals close without animation
- Don't use linear easing — always ease-out or spring
