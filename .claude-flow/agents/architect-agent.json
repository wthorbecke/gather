Look for components over 500 lines that need splitting\n3. Find duplicated logic that should be extracted\n4. Identify performance issues (too many re-renders, missing memoization)\n5. Create tasks in the claude-flow queue for refactoring work\n\nPrioritize by impact. Focus on src/components/ especially StackView.tsx, GatherApp.tsx, and UnifiedInput.tsx.\n\nDO NOT refactor yourself. Only analyze and create tasks.",
